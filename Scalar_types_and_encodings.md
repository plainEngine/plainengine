# Introduction #

When you want to register delegate class, you'll need to declare some methods and include some type information. In Objective-C subjects this is being handled automatically by runtime, but this is impossible for subjects, written in other languages. For this purpose, plainEngine uses Objective-C type encodings. Type encoding is c-string, which is defined for every scalar type.

# Encodings table #

PlainEngine supports quite definite number of scalar types. This is table of supported types and their encodings:

| **Type** | **Encoding** |
|:---------|:-------------|
| `double` | `"d"` |
| `float` | `"f"` |
| `long` | `"l"` |
| `unsigned long` | `"L"` |
| `long long` | `"q"` |
| `unsigned long long` | `"Q"` |
| `char` | `"c"` |
| `unsigned char` | `"C"` |
| `short` | `"s"` |
| `unsigned short` | `"S"` |
| `int` | `"i"` |
| `unsigned int` | `"I"` |
