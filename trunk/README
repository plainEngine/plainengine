Plain Engine planed as a simple to use game engine 

Before compilation make sure that GNUstep is installed on your computer (if you use Linux or Windows)
To compile just run make or ./compile; Also you may follow these steps from project root directory:

1) . ./src/envsetup.sh
2) cd sc_gen_src
3) make
4) cd ../src
5) make

To create GNUstep documentation for project run ./createdoc.sh

There are some demos in the bin directory
Also you need SDL to be able to compile sprite render, and Bullet SDK for physics subject.
Building for windows works, bt with tambourine. Soon special makes will be added
